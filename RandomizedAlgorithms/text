1. Warm-up: You toss a coin till you get tails. How many tosses there will be, on average?
2. X or smaller — There is a hidden number 𝑋. An interactor repeatedly gives you a number,
 either 𝑋 or something smaller than 𝑋. All numbers are positive integers.
 When can you stop and say that you are (almost) certain what is the value of 𝑋?


3. Line through N/4 points — Given 𝑁≤105 points, find a line
that passes through the maximum number of points.
It's guaranteed that the answer is at least 𝑁/4.

- Probability of not encountering max =

4. GCD (364D - Ghd) — given a set of 𝑁≤106 numbers,
each up to 1012, find the maximum possible number that is a
divisor of at least half of given numbers.

5. ACTG prefix — Guess a hidden string 𝑆 with characters A, C, T, G.
You can choose some string and ask if it's a prefix of 𝑆. The length of 𝑆
is at most 10000 and you can ask up to 25000 queries.
