/*

You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first
number is always smaller than the second number. A pair (c, d)
can follow another pair (a, b) if b < c. Chain of pairs can be
formed in this fashion. Find the longest chain which can be formed
from a given set of pairs.
Source: Amazon Interview | Set 2

For example, if the given pairs are {{5, 24}, {39, 60},
{15, 28}, {27, 40}, {50, 90} }, then the longest chain
that can be formed is of length 3, and the chain is {{5, 24}, {27, 40}, {50, 90}}
